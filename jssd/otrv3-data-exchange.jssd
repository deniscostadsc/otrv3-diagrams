title: OTRv3 - Data exchange

Note right of Alice: Picks the most recent of her own D-H encryption\nkeys that Bob has acknowledged receiving (by\nusing it in a Data Message, or failing that, in \n the AKE). Let keyA be that key, and let keyidA\nbe its serial number.
Note right of Alice: If the above key is Alice's most recent key,\nshe generates a new D-H key (next_dh), to get\nthe serial number keyidA+1.
Note right of Alice: Picks the most recent of Bob's D-H encryption \n keys that she has received from him (either in a \n Data Message or in the AKE). Let keyB by that \n key, and let keyidB be its serial number.
Note right of Alice: Uses Diffie-Hellman to compute a shared secret \n from the two keys keyA and keyB, and generates \n the sending AES key, ek, and the sending MAC key, \n mk, as detailed below.
Note right of Alice: Collects any old MAC keys that were used in \n previous messages, but will never again be used \n (because their associated D-H keys are no longer \n the most recent ones) into a list, oldmackeys.
